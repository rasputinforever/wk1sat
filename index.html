        <p>
            Erik Portillo was born in Glendale, California in 1986 on the 13th day of March. It is a famous day, as all people know, because it is the day when the Black Sea Incidident occured when the American ship USS Yorktown and the USS Caron entered Soviet waters near the Crimean Peninsula, in the Black Sea. As this was such a historical event it goes without saying how important that day was, and without it, this passage would never have been written as there wouldn't be a person to document it 34 years later.
