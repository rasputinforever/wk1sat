        Erik Portillo was born in Glendale, California. He is 30-something years old and loves his cats. He is a chemist and a future coder. Something about Erik that's interesting, he saw Jay Leno once walking around in a denim-heavy outfit and was surrounded by burly looking guys also wearing lots of denim.
